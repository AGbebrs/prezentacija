    <h1>Sporting CP</h1>
    <p>After impressing in Sporting's youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni.
         At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the first team,
          in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan, and his Primeira Liga debut,
           took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.
           Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.
            Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.
        
        Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
         after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially,
          United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been impressed by him,
           the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game,
            Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players"
             he had ever seen.</p>

      <h1>Manchester United</h1>
      <p>Manchester United's signed Ronaldo for £12 million on 12 August 2003, an England record for a teenager.
         This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.
               </p>
      <p>Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003.
        His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.
        In the 2006–07 season, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season,
         winning the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, Young Player of the Year awards,
          and the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,
           becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours. Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,
            and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.</p>

      <h1>Real Madrid</h1>
      <p>In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million.
         At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu,
          surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.

               </p>
      <p> Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.
         He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.
          His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.
           His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty,
            which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.
             Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid's 96 points in La Liga,
              his first season with Madrid ended trophyless.</p>

      <h1>Juventus</h1>
      <p>Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million,
         the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club.
          Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,
         but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.

               </p>
      <p> On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona.
         On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juve, he was sent off against Valencia,
          his first red card in 154 Champions League appearances.[147] In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia,
           Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first ever player to do so.
           Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana,
            after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.
             On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league,
              equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.
               On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16,
                helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.
                 On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina,
                  as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win,
                   thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.
                    With 21 goals and eight assists, Ronaldo won the league award for Most Valuable Player.</p>

      <h1>Juventus</h1>
      <p>On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo,
         subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.
          Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.
           The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer,
            overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.

               </p>
      <p> On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford,
         scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.
          On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League,
           and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.
            Ronaldo proved to be crucial in the next Champions League fixtures,
             scoring various last minute goals to help United qualify for the round of 16 as group winners.
              On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.
               Struggles ensued, with a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager,
               continuing for two months,
                until he scored in United's 2–0 win at home versus Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022,
                 his first in the new year.
                  He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award,
                   but United finished in a disappointing sixth place and qualified for the UEFA Europa League;
                    as a result, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.</p>
